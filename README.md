# Phase One App

This is a guide to help you set up the Phase One App project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- pnpm (install with `npm install -g pnpm`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Navigate into the project directory with `cd <project-directory>`.
3. Install the project dependencies with `pnpm install`.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference for the required environment variables. Fill in the necessary values.

- `VITE_RPC_PROVIDER_MAINNET`: URL for the Ethereum mainnet RPC provider
- `VITE_RPC_PROVIDER_SEPOLIA`: URL for the Sepolia network RPC provider (used for testing and development)
- `VITE_RPC_PROVIDER_TENDERLY`: URL for the Tenderly RPC provider (used for testing and development)
- `VITE_TESTNET_CONFIG`: Boolean flag to determine network config to use, should be `false` in production
- `VITE_AUTH_URL`: Base URL for the authentication service
- `VITE_RESTRICTED_BUILD`: Boolean flag to enable certain restrictions
- `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: Project ID for WalletConnect integration
- `VITE_SKIP_AUTH_CHECK`: Boolean flag to bypass authentication checks during development
- `NPM_TOKEN`: Token for accessing private npm packages or registries
- `TENDERLY_API_KEY`: API key for Tenderly (used for forking and managing virtual networks for testing)
- `VITE_USE_MOCK_WALLET`: Boolean flag to enable the use of a mock wallet for testing purposes
- `VITE_TERMS_ENDPOINT`: URL endpoint for submitting and checking terms acceptance
- `VITE_TERMS_LINK`: Array containing links to terms of use
- `VITE_FOOTER_LINKS`: Array containing footer links with their URLs and names
- `VITE_TERMS_MESSAGE_TO_SIGN`: Message that users need to sign to accept the terms and conditions
- `VITE_TERMS_CHECKBOX_TEXT`: The text displayed next to the checkbox in the terms acceptance modal
- `VITE_ENV_NAME`: (Optional) Environment name (e.g., 'development', 'staging', 'production')
- `VITE_CF_PAGES_COMMIT_SHA`: (Optional) Git commit hash of the current build

## Running the App

To start the development server, run `pnpm dev`.

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Testing

To run the e2e tests, run `pnpm e2e` or `pnpm e2e:ui` to run in ui mode.

These will fork a tenderly vnet, run the e2e tests, then delete the fork. You'll need to run node version >20.6 and also have the `TENDERLY_API_KEY` environment variable set in your local environment to fork and delete the vnet. Additionally, to run the testing environment locally, set `VITE_USE_MOCK_WALLET=true` in env vars.

The regular mode will automatically run all tests, and then generate a report including recordings of tests, whereas in ui mode, you can select which tests to run in the ui, and watch the tests run in real time.

You can download the [Playwright VS Code](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode) extension and run the tests from VS Code (works with Cursor too). Simply click the button to the left of the test code to run a test individually.

The VS code extension can also help with [generating tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen).

Note that when you try to initiate a transaction using this feature, the transaction will fail because the RPC interception has not been setup to add the gas parameter. You'll run into the same issue if you run `pnpm dev:mock`.

## Building the App

To build the application for production, run `pnpm build`.

## Linting and Formatting

To lint the project, use `pnpm lint`.

To format the project, use `pnpm prettier`.

There's also a precommit hook that runs eslint and prettier on all staged files.

## Additional Docs

For more detailed information, you can refer to the following documents in the `docs` folder:

- [User Suggested Actions Construction](docs/generating-user-actions.md): This document explains how the `fetchUserSuggestedActions` function generates personalized actions for users based on their token balances and available reward opportunities.
