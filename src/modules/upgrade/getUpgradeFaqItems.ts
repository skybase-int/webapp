    question: 'What is USDS?',
    answer:
      'USDS is the stablecoin of the decentralised Sky Protocol. It can be used in several ways, including to participate in the Sky Savings Rate and get Sky Token Rewards without giving up control. It is the upgraded version of DAI.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I trade USDS?',
    answer:
      'Yes. you can trade USDS, as well as USDC, USDT and ETH, for SKY via the Sky Protocol. USDS is freely transferable and can be used in connection with any software protocol or platform that supports it.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is SKY, and how can I get it and use it?',
    answer: `SKY is a native governance token of the decentralised Sky ecosystem and the upgraded version of Maker's legacy governance token, MKR. You can upgrade your MKR to SKY at the rate of 1:24,000 via the Sky Protocol.

You can trade SKY for USDS and, soon, use it to accumulate Activation Token Rewards and participate in Sky ecosystem governance through a system of decentralised onchain voting.`
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I have to upgrade my DAI to USDS, and my MKR to SKY?',
    answer: `No. DAI and MKR will remain unaltered in their original forms for the foreseeable future. You can continue to hold and use both tokens exactly as you have in the past. While each has an upgraded Sky version, upgrading is optional. But only by holding USDS and SKY can you utilise the Sky Protocol functionalities available in your region.

Note that decisions regarding the Sky Protocol, its tokens and features are made by Sky ecosystem governance token holders through a system of decentralised on-chain voting.`
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does it cost to upgrade?',
    answer:
      'Upgrading is free and instant; however, you will likely pay gas fees for using the Ethereum blockchain network. That fee is not controlled, imposed or received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol. It is calculated based on current Ethereum network demand and the amount of gas required to process the upgrade transaction. So, be sure to have ETH in your wallet anytime you transact using the Sky Protocol.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are DAI and MKR going away?',
    answer: `Sky governance has not indicated that DAI and MKR are going away. Accordingly, they are expected to remain unaltered in their original forms for the foreseeable future, unless Sky governance decides otherwise. In the meantime, you can continue to hold and use both tokens exactly as you have in the past. While each token now has an upgraded version, the decision to upgrade your tokens is optional.

Note that decisions regarding the decentralised Sky Protocol, its tokens, and features are made by Sky ecosystem governance token holders through a system of decentralised on-chain voting.`
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to the DAI I've supplied to the DAI Savings Rate contract?",
    answer: `The DAI Savings Rate (DSR) contract remains unchanged for now, so you don't need to immediately do anything to your DAI in the DSR module. Eligible users can, however, withdraw their DSR position, upgrade their DAI to USDS, and then use their USDS to access the Sky Savings Rate.

When you supply USDS to the Sky Savings Rate module, you receive sUSDS savings tokens in return. When you choose to redeem your sUSDS for USDS—which you can do anytime—the total USDS you will receive will equal the amount you originally supplied, plus any rewards accumulated. No minimum supply amount is required to access the SSR, and you always maintain full control of your supplied funds.`
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I borrow USDS like I borrowed DAI?',
    answer:
      '[Spark](http://Spark.fi), the very first Sky Star and already a top DeFi liquidity protocol, offers Easy Borrow, a feature that enables you to borrow USDS in a way that is similar to how DAI was supplied.'
