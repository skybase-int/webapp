    question: 'What is the Sky Savings Rate, and how does it work?',
    answer: `The Sky Savings Rate (SSR) is an automated token-accumulation mechanism of the decentralised Sky Protocol that takes into account the effect of accumulated USDS compounded in real time. In other words, the USDS you supply to the Sky Savings Rate module enables you to receive sUSDS. The SSR is variable, determined not by market factors but by Sky ecosystem governance through a process of decentralised onchain voting.

When you supply USDS to the Sky Savings Rate module, you access the SSR and may receive sUSDS tokens in return. These sUSDS tokens serve as a digital record of your USDS interaction with the SSR module and any value accrued to your position.

The decentralised Sky Protocol dynamically adds USDS tokens to the pool every few seconds, in accordance with the Sky Savings Rate. As those tokens auto-accumulate in the pool over time, the value of the sUSDS you hold may gradually increase.

So, when you choose to redeem your sUSDS for USDS—which you can do anytime—the total USDS you will receive will equal the amount you originally supplied, plus any additional USDS accumulated. With the Sky Protocol, you're always in full control of your supplied assets, as this feature is non-custodial.`

    question: 'Does it cost anything to access the Sky Savings Rate?',
    answer:
      'Accessing the Sky Savings Rate via the Sky Protocol is free. However, any time you supply or withdraw assets to/from the Sky Savings Rate module, you will incur a transaction fee— called a gas fee—for using the Ethereum blockchain network. That fee is not controlled, imposed or received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol.'

    question: 'What is USDS?',
    answer:
      'USDS is the stablecoin of the decentralised Sky Protocol. It can be used in several ways, including to participate in the Sky Savings Rate and get Sky Token Rewards without giving up control. It is the upgraded version of DAI.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I withdraw my USDS from the Sky Savings Rate module anytime?',
    answer:
      'You can withdraw your original supply of USDS and any accumulated sUSDS from the Sky Savings Rate module anytime. While no withdrawal fee is imposed, you will pay a blockchain transaction fee— called a gas fee—for using the network. That fee is not controlled, imposed or received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol.'
