## **1\. The Services**

### **1.1 The Interface**

The Interface provides both web and mobile access to the fully non-custodial, blockchain-based software protocol known as the “Sky Protocol,” which operates on the Ethereum blockchain, and may extend to several Ethereum Layer 2 solutions in the future. The Interface is distinct from the Sky Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Sky Protocol. The Sky Protocol consists of open-source, self-executing, autonomous smart contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. For the avoidance of doubt, Skybase International does not control or operate any version of the Sky Protocol on any blockchain network and the Sky Protocol is not part of the Services. You may access the Interface via your non-custodial digital wallet, which allows you to directly interact with public blockchains. Your use of a non-custodial digital wallet is governed by the applicable terms of service of the third-party digital wallet provider.

New versions and upgrades to the Sky Protocol may be released from time to time, subject to the independent governance rules of the Sky Protocol. The Services may not be compatible with prior, abandoned or outdated versions of the Sky Protocol. Skybase International undertakes no responsibility or obligation to update or maintain the Interface to support legacy versions of the Sky Protocol. The Services may also become degraded or unexpectedly unavailable at times. To the extent you are using the Services to interact with the Sky Protocol, this could result in delays in accessing the Sky Protocol and your funds. We assume no responsibility or liability for any loss of, or delayed access to, your funds or otherwise delayed or failed transactions arising out of or in connection with any such degradation or unavailability of the Services.

### **1.2 Availability of Third-Party Products and Services**

We reserve the right to make certain third-party products and services available to you through API integrations with third-party providers or blockchain-based integrations. Any such third-party products and services may include integrations, links, or other access to third-party services, sites, technology, content, and resources. By choosing to use these third-party products and services, you acknowledge and agree that your use of such products and services is subject to any terms and conditions, privacy policies, and other applicable agreements of the respective third-party providers. It is your responsibility to review and understand these terms before utilizing any third-party products and services available through the Interface. We disclaim any liability for any issues arising from your use of these third-party products and services, including, but not limited to, any breach of contract, privacy, or data security issues. You, and not Skybase International will be responsible for any and all fees and charges associated with your use of any third-party services. Skybase International enables access to these third-party services merely as a convenience, and the inclusion of a third-party service on the Interface does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of that third partyʼs products and services. Any dealings that you have with third parties while using the Services, such as the Interface, are between you and that third party.

Skybase International will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused, by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any third-party products and services. Skybase International has no control over, and is not responsible for the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of such third-party products and services. We encourage you to review the terms of use and privacy policies of the third-party providers prior to using such products and services. Some third-party products or services will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to such parties through your use of the third-party services, and we will use, store, and disclose such information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. For more information on the implications of using any products and services made available via the Services through third-party integrations or otherwise, including our use, storage, and disclosure of information related to you and your use of such third-party services within the Services, please see our Privacy Policy.

### **1.3 Other Products and Services**

We may, from time to time, in the future offer to you additional products and services. Such products and services shall be considered part of the Services, irrespective of whether such product is specifically defined in these Terms.

### **1.4 Modifications of the Services**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, and without any liability to you, to modify, substitute, eliminate, add, or discontinue all or part of any of the Services at any time, including access to products and services made available via any thirdparty API integrations or links or blockchain-based integrations. We further reserve the right to review, modify, filter, disable, delete, and remove any and all content and information from any of the Services at any time, and without any liability to you.

### **1.5 Informational Resources**

We may also make certain informational resources relating to the Sky Protocol, including, without limitation, the documentation on the Website, blog posts, data, articles, tutorials, social media posts and other informational content published by us, our employees or marketing partners (“**Informational Resources**”), available to you as part of the Services. The Informational Resources provided are not exhaustive and may not cover all aspects of or potential developments concerning the Sky Protocol. You acknowledge and agree that all such Informational Resources are intended for informational and educational purposes only and are not the exclusive or sole source of information regarding the Sky Protocol. Skybase International shall not be responsible or liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use or reliance on any Informational Resources. We assume no responsibility for keeping the Informational Resources up to date and/or accurate.

### **1.6 User Control of Cryptoassets**

You understand, acknowledge and agree that neither we, nor any of our affiliates, are party to any transaction on the Sky Protocol. We do not retain possession, custody, or control over any user cryptoassets at any time. Due to the decentralized, non-custodial nature of the Sky Protocol, Sky Protocol users retain exclusive control over their cryptoassets at all times. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your private keys to your digital wallet/s, and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a digital wallet, and we make no representations or warranties regarding how any of the Services will operate with any type of digital wallet. Further, we accept no liability for any acts or omissions by you in connection with, or as a result of, your digital wallet being compromised.

These Terms are not intended to, and do not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and to the extent that any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe to you are those expressly set forth in these Terms.

### **1.7 Transaction Fees**

Blockchain transactions, including transactions occurring through the Sky Protocol, may require the payment of network transaction fees (i.e., gas fees). You will be solely responsible to pay the gas fees for any transaction that you initiate via any of the Services or through a third-party integration. You will also be responsible for any service or transaction fees assessed by, or in connection with your use of, the Sky Protocol, which may be updated from time to time in accordance with the governance construct of the Sky Protocol.

Your use of the Services, such as the Interface, to access the Sky Protocol, may result in various tax obligations or consequences, such as income or capital gains tax.

It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Skybase International, its affiliates, successors, and assigns, and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives (collectively, the "**Skybase Parties**”). It also limits the manner in which you can seek relief from the Skybase Parties.

In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in relation to these Terms, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute amicably through good-faith negotiations.

If the dispute set out in a Notice is not resolved by negotiation within sixty 60) days from the date of notification, the dispute shall be referred to arbitration.

Both you and the Skybase parties agree that this informal dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against any other party.

### **5.2. Applicability of the Arbitration Agreement**

All unresolved disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to any of the Services or these Terms shall be finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the Cayman Islands Association of Mediators and Arbitrators (“**CI MAC**”), which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.

If there is any inconsistency between any term of the CI MAC Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.

This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms, the Services, or any connection you may have to the information you obtained from the Interface.

### **5.3. Terms of the Arbitration**

The following terms shall apply to any Arbitration proceedings commenced under this Agreement:

· The number of arbitrators shall be one.

· All negotiations and arbitration proceedings related to any dispute (including, but not limited to, any settlements, awards, and the fact that they have taken place) shall be kept confidential by the parties, their representatives, and any participants in the arbitration, except as may be required by law or to enforce any settlement or arbitration award.

· Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with any arbitration proceedings, except that the arbitrator may award costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysʼ fees) to the prevailing party as part of the arbitration award.

### **5.4. Exclusions and other terms**

This dispute resolution process shall not preclude either party from seeking interim or injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, including relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms, shall be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.

If this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither party is entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim or dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to the Terms.

## **6\. Governing Law**

# Appendix A

**Participation in the X Activation Campaign**

## **Rewards**

For the avoidance of doubt, participation in the Campaign does not guarantee receipt of rewards (hereinafter “**Rewards**” or “**Boosted Rewards**”). Skybase International does not control or guarantee any aspect of the Campaign with respect to Rewards. The existence, distribution, nature, amount, and criteria for any Rewards is determined solely by Sky governance and is subject to change at any time.

## **Campaign Overview**

At the direction of Sky governance, the X Activation Campaign (the “**Campaign**”) will run from 20 August to 18 September 2024. Following this period, eligible users may claim boosted rewards through the Sky Protocol, to the extent that such rewards are made available via the Sky Protocol. User participation in the Campaign requires the acceptance of these terms outlined in this X Activation Campaign Appendix, the Terms of Use, and the Privacy Policy. The detailed acceptance process is outlined below.

## **Acceptance and Blockchain Verification**

After following the eligibility prompts on the Interface, users must then connect their digital wallet, which will summon a pop-up window containing the applicable

Sky legal terms and conditions. Users must click on and review the hyperlinked

Terms of Use, including the X Activation Campaign Appendix, and Privacy Policy. Once reviewed, users must then affirmatively accept the legal terms by clicking a checkbox in the pop-up window. The users must then sign an on-chain message with a unique identifier that will be provided to confirm that they have read and accepted the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

## **Campaign Duration and Reward Details**

The Campaign is limited in time and will end on 18 September 2024, but we reserve the right to end or extend the Campaign at any time and in our sole and complete discretion. At the culmination of the Campaign, users can claim their boosted rewards, with the same digital wallet address that they initially supplied to participate in the Campaign, through the Sky Protocol. Eligibility for boosted rewards does not guarantee receipt thereof. The claiming process is determined by Sky's community drive governance and is subject to modification.

## **Reward Claiming Process**

In connection with the Campaign, we reserve the right to remove, restrict, or modify access to the boosted rewards claiming system within the Interface at any time. Rewards are not distributed by Skybase International, nor does Skybase International exercise control over said distribution. Instead, eligible users will directly connect to the Sky Protocol via their digital wallet address to claim their rewards. It is the responsibility of eligible users to follow the instructions for claiming rewards provided within the Interface within the timeframe specified by the sky.money website.

You will have the opportunity to claim your Rewards through the Interface until 30 December 2024. Beyond this date, Skybase International will discontinue the availability of the claiming function within the Interface.

## **Eligibility Criteria**

To become eligible to participate in the Campaign and to claim boosted rewards, users must: (i) comply with all other aspects of this X Activation Campaign Appendix, as well as the Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy, including any eligibility requirements and instructions set forth therein or herein; (ii) not reside in, be located or incorporated in or have a registered office in, the United States of America.

## **No Liability for Token Distribution**

Skybase International is not the issuer of any tokens and it does not control the implementation or the operations of the reward mechanisms as rewards are programmatically generated via the smart contracts that comprise the Sky Protocol and established by the community-driven governance process of Sky (formerly known as MakerDAO . Skybase International expressly disclaims any liability related to the implementation, distribution, or non-distribution of rewards.

Skybase Internationalʼs role is limited to facilitating your access to the Campaign under the Terms. The distribution of any rewards is outside Skybase Internationalʼs control and depends exclusively on the Sky Protocol and Sky governance processes.

## **Reward Mechanism and Eligibility**

The specific details of the reward mechanism, including but not limited to the method of reward calculation, distribution criteria, and eligibility requirements, are solely controlled and determined by Sky (formerly known as MakerDAO) and its community-driven governance processes. Users acknowledge and agree that: (i) the reward mechanism, calculation methods, and eligibility criteria may change at any time without prior notice to users, as determined by Sky's governance processes; (ii) Skybase International has no influence over the reward mechanisms, and any changes to them and is not responsible for communicating them to users; (iii) the final determination of reward amounts, if any, and user eligibility rests entirely with Sky governance and the Sky Protocol; (iv) Skybase International makes no representations or guarantees regarding the consistency, fairness, or continuation of the reward mechanism or eligibility criteria; (v) users are responsible for staying informed about any changes to the reward system by monitoring official Sky communication channels; (vi) a userʼs participation in the Campaign does not guarantee their eligibility for rewards; (vii) Skybase Internationalʼs role is limited to providing a point of access to the Sky Protocol and does not extend to the determination or implementation of rewards in connection with the Campaign.

By participating in the Campaign, you represent that you acknowledge, understand, and agree to these conditions regarding the reward mechanism and eligibility criteria.

## **Amendments to Campaign Terms**

Skybase International reserves the right to modify the terms of the Campaign at any time, at the direction of Sky governance. Any modifications will be communicated through Skybase Internationalʼs communication channels (namely the @skyecosystem X account) and are effective immediately upon posting unless otherwise specified. A userʼs participation in the Campaign after any such changes constitutes the userʼs acceptance of the new terms.

## **Data Processing**

We encourage eligible participants to review the Privacy Policy for detailed information on how their data will be processed in relation to the Campaign.

# Appendix B

**Supplemental Terms**

**Sky Token Rewards**

Eligible users of the Sky Protocol may access protocol rewards through the Rewards tab of the Web App. Users may access token rewards through various protocol features including (i) Activation Rewards (which locks SKY or Sky SubDAO tokens in a relevant Sky Protocol smart contract to programmatically generate rewards); (ii) USDS Token Rewards (which locks USDS in a relevant Sky Protocol smart contract to programmatically generate rewards); and (iii) Sealed Activation (which locks MKR or SKY in a relevant Sky Protocol smart contract to programmatically generate rewards, subject to an exit fee determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance that starts at 5%, including any other relevant additional terms applicable at the Sky Protocol level, and which allows users to borrow against their supplied assets). The aforementioned rewards generating contracts are non-custodial, so eligible users retain control over their cryptoassets at all times. Accumulated rewards may take the form of DeFi project tokens that are non-native to the Sky Protocol (_e.g._, SPK and CLE). Any such non-native rewards may be subject to third-party DeFi project terms and conditions. Reward rates are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance, and/or the relevant governance body of such third-party DeFi projects, subject to change and are in no way guaranteed. This feature is not available to users of the Sky Protocol, accessed through the Services, in select jurisdictions including the U.S.

**Chronicle Points Program**

Eligible users of the Sky Protocol may access Chronicle token rewards (_i.e._, “**Chronicle Points**”) through the protocol’s Rewards feature. A user’s accumulated points will appear on the interface as “Accumulated Rewards.” These rewards are reflected as points (_i.e._, CLE points), and the dashboard counter will display the number of CLE points that a user has accumulated. These accumulated rewards are not claimable or in any way convertible into CLE tokens through the Web App, and Chronicle Points are not a native feature of the Sky Protocol. Any future claiming of CLE tokens, if ever made accessible, may occur within the relevant Chronicle entity’s (“Chronicle”) infrastructure or applications. A Chronicle entity controls and operates the points program. Skybase International does not control or guarantee the availability, distribution, or allocation of Chronicle Points or any other Chronicle assets. Chronicle projects operate independently of the Website and Skybase International. Any engagement with Chronicle projects, infrastructure, or applications is at your own risk, subject to Chronicle’s terms and conditions, and we bear no responsibility for any outcomes associated with this third-party system, or any assets associated with it.

**Third-Party Services and Trading Fees**

Users of the Sky Protocol may access third-party decentralized exchanges (“DEXs”) via API integration for trading activities (_e.g._, the “Swap” feature powered by CoW Swap). Please note that the Sky Protocol does not control, manage, or operate any such DEXs, and any trades executed through such third-party platforms are subject to the respective DEX’s terms and conditions, fee structures, and any other applicable policies. The DEXs may impose trading fees, gas fees, and other charges, which are determined solely by the DEX and are beyond the control of the Sky Protocol.

By using the DEXs through the Web App, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) the Sky Protocol is not responsible for any fees or charges imposed by the DEXs; (ii) any disputes, losses, or liabilities arising from your use of the DEXs, including fees and transaction errors, are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective DEX; and (iii) you are solely responsible for reviewing and understanding the DEX’s terms of use and applicable fees prior to engaging in any transactions.

**Independent Subdomains**

Certain sky.money subdomains accessible through the Sky Protocol front-end user interfaces are not controlled, operated, or maintained by Skybase International. These subdomains are independent websites controlled and managed by independent third parties within the Sky Ecosystem, each of which may have its own terms and conditions, privacy policies, and other governing terms. Skybase International does not endorse, monitor, or accept any liability for any content, functionality, or services provided on any other external sites hosted under the sky.money subdomains.

By accessing or interacting with these external sites hosted under the sky.money subdomains, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) Skybase International is not liable for any content, services, or any interactions that occur on or through these subdomains; (ii) you are solely responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions of those independent subdomains; and (iii) any risks associated with using such subdomains are borne entirely by you.
